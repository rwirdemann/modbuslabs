# Slavesim Configuration File
# This file defines the transport handlers and slaves for the Modbus slave simulator

# Transport handlers define the communication endpoints
# Type can be "tcp" or "rtu"

[[transport]]
type = "tcp"
address = "localhost:502"

[[transport]]
type = "tcp"
address = "localhost:503"

# Example RTU transport (uncomment to use):
# [[transport]]
# type = "rtu"
# address = "/tmp/virtualcom0"

# Slave definitions
# Each slave has an ID and is connected to a specific transport address

[[slave]]
id = 101
address = "localhost:502"

# Example: Add more slaves as needed
# [[slave]]
# id = 102
# address = "localhost:503"

# [[slave]]
# id = 103
# address = "/tmp/virtualcom0"
